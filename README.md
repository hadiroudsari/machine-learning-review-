## Supervised Learning Vs Unsupervised Learning vs Reinforcment learning 

### Supervised learning:
The kind of algorithm that has some kind of data set (index and attribute and has the lable for those attribute). for any entry data this algorithm check the attribute of new unlable data with the attribute of labled data, and if these two are match together it will lable the new data. 

### Algorithms:  

**Discrete Classifiers**
  * Decision Trees
  * Decision Forests
  * SVM   
  
 **Continous (Regression ) classifiers:**
  * Neural networks
  
 **Probability estimators:**
  * Naive Bayes  
----

### UnSupervised learning: 
 Unsupervised model does not have any label sample so it check the input behaviour and shape and cluster input to diferent output. 

### Algorithm:  
 * Convolutional Neural Network(semi-supervised)
 * Rule Learning (Apriri,FPGrows)
 * Clustring()

### Reinforment learninh
  a kinf of learning that system learn from different things based on penalties and rewards.
  **Algoritm for reinforcment learning**
   * Q-learning
   * Genetic algorithms

  `Learning: optimization problem The idea is to learn a function that minimizes an error or one that maximizes reward over    penalty.`  
   Given a selected model, during the learning phase, several model ***hyper-parameters*** need to be optimized.  
   
***Hyper-parameter** is a parameter whose value must be set before the learning process begins. For example, the maximum depth of a decision tree, the number of hidden layers in a neural network, the type of kernel function in SVM, the type of similarity function in clustering, etc.
